THIS MODULE ADDS A VIRTUAL KEYBOARD TO THE INPUT OF YOUR CHOICE=<h2>Multilingual Virtual Keyboard</h2><img src="/modules/mod_search_vk/keyboard/keyboard.png" width="56" height="26" style="float:right;"><p>This is a Joomla module for multilingual virtual keyboard functionality in input fields. The keyboard is based on the <a href="http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard" target="_blank">JavaScript Graphical / Virtual Keyboard Interface</a> by GreyWyvern.</p><h3>First steps</h3><p>Disable the module title, enable the module and position it where it doesn't produce any styling, for example in the footer. It must be in a position which is defined by your template. If there are problems with the template, try a different position.<h3>Applying keyboard to an input field</h3><p>On pages where the module is active, you can add the virtual keyboard the input field(s) of your choice.<br />Simply determine the class in 'input class'. This is most likely 'inputbox'.<br />If you need the keyboard for fields with different classes, create a new module of the keyboard in the modules mananger and define the according class there.</p><h3>Localise the keyboard</h3><p>You can adjust all keys, tooltips and language names to your needs manually. If you have a multilingual site with <b>Joomfish</b>, you can have the keyboard localised for each language by simply making a translation of this module.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>All keyboards are active by default. Consider turning off keyboards you don't need in order to save loading time.</p><h3>Known issues</h3><p>In some cases the activation of this module causes problems with the display of the site. The solution is to choose a different position.</p><h3>Help</h3><p>For help, feedback and more information please go to the <a href="http://podolak.net/en/webdesign/multilingual-virtual-keyboard-for-joomla" target="_blank">module homepage</a>.</p>
